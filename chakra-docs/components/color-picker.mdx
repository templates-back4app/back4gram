<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-basic" />

## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`color-picker` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add color-picker
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `ColorPicker`
component.

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  ColorPickerArea,
  ColorPickerContent,
  ColorPickerControl,
  ColorPickerEyeDropper,
  ColorPickerInput,
  ColorPickerLabel,
  ColorPickerRoot,
  ColorPickerSliders,
  ColorPickerTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/color-picker"
```

```jsx
<ColorPickerRoot>
  <ColorPickerLabel />
  <ColorPickerControl>
    <ColorPickerInput />
    <ColorPickerTrigger />
  </ColorPickerControl>
  <ColorPickerContent>
    <ColorPickerArea />
    <ColorPickerEyeDropper />
    <ColorPickerSliders />
  </ColorPickerContent>
</ColorPickerRoot>
```

## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-sizes" />

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the visual style of the color picker. Values
can be either `outline` or `subtle`.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-variants" />

### Input Only

Combine the `ColorPickerValueSwatch` and the `ColorPickerEyeDropper` on the
`InputGroup` to render a color picker that contains only an input.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-input-only" />

### Swatch Only

Use the `ColorPickerSwatchGroup` and `ColorPickerSwatchTrigger` to render only
the color swatches.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-swatch-only" />

### Trigger Only

Compose the color picker to initially show only a trigger using the
`ColorPickerValueSwatch` and `ColorPickerValueText`.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-trigger-only" />

### Trigger Inside Input

Compose the color picker to trigger in input using the `InputGroup` and
`ColorPickerInput`.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-trigger-only" />

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the state of the color
picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-controlled" />

### Store

An alternative way to control the color picker is to use the `RootProvider`
component and the `useColorPicker` store hook.

This way you can access the color picker state and methods from outside the
color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-store" />

### Change End

Use the `onValueChangeEnd` to listen to when the user finishes selecting a
color, rather than while they are scrubbing or dragging through the color area.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-change-end" />

### Channel Slider

Combine the `ColorPickerChannelSliders` and the `format` prop to add the
different color channels to the color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-channel-slider-only" />

### Hook Form

Here's an example of how to integrate the color picker with `react-hook-form`.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-hook-form" />

### Inline

Use the `ColorPickerInlineContent` and pass `open` to the `ColorPickerRoot` to
display an inline version of the color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-inline" />

### Disabled

Pass the `disabled` prop to disable the color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-disabled" />

### Channel Input

Use the `ChannelFormatSelect` and `ColorPickerChannelInputs` to create a color
picker that allows users to select their preferred channel.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-channel-input" />

### Fit Content

Here's an example of how to create a rounded trigger that fits the content.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-fit-content" />

### ReadOnly

Use the `readOnly` prop to make the color picker component read-only.

### Save Swatch

Here's an example of how to save a selected color as a swatch.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-save-swatch" />

### Swatches

Here's an example of how to combine the color picker with pre-defined swatches.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-swatches" />
