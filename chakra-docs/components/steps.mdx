<ExampleTabs name="steps-basic" />

## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`steps` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add steps
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Steps` component.

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  StepsCompletedContent,
  StepsContent,
  StepsItem,
  StepsList,
  StepsNextTrigger,
  StepsPrevTrigger,
  StepsRoot,
} from "@/components/ui/steps"
```

```jsx
<StepsRoot>
  <StepsList>
    <StepsItem />
  </StepsList>
  <StepsContent />
  <StepsCompleteContent />
  <StepsPrevTrigger />
  <StepsNextTrigger />
</StepsRoot>
```

## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the steps component.

<ExampleTabs name="steps-with-sizes" />

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the appearance of the steps component.

<ExampleTabs name="steps-with-variants" />

### Colors

Use the `colorPalette` prop to change the color scheme of the component.

<ExampleTabs name="steps-with-colors" />

### Vertical

Use the `orientation` prop to change the orientation of the steps component.

<ExampleTabs name="steps-vertical" />

### Controlled

Use the `step` and `onStepChange` props to control the current step of the steps
component.

<ExampleTabs name="steps-controlled" />

### Store

An alternative way to control the steps is to use the `RootProvider` component
and the `useSteps` store hook.

This way you can access the steps state and methods from outside the steps.

<ExampleTabs name="steps-with-store" />

### Icon

Pass the `icon` prop to the `StepsItem` component to display an icon.

<ExampleTabs name="steps-with-icon" />

### Description

Pass the `description` prop to the `StepsItem` component to display a
description.

<ExampleTabs name="steps-with-description" />

## Props

### Root

<PropTable component="Steps" part="Root" />
